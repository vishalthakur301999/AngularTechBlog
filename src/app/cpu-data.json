      "articlecontents": "The eight-core Core i9-11900K slots in as the flagship model for the Rocket Lake family. Fast clock speeds are a clear attraction, but they come at the expense of power â€” two of the chip's cores boost to a peak of 5.3 GHz, and all cores can operate at 4.8 GHz simultaneously. The 11900K has a 125W PL1 power rating (at the base frequency) and a 250W PL2 (boost) rating, both of which are identical to the previous-gen 10900K despite having two fewer cores. \n\nThe Core i9 K and KF models are Intel's first chips to come with Adaptive Boost Technology (ABT), which allows the processors to dynamically boost to higher all-core frequencies based upon available thermal headroom and electrical conditions (a bit more detail below). This new tech will feel decidedly familiar to AMD fans, as it operates in a very similar fashion to AMD's existing boost mechanism that's present in newer Ryzen processors. \n\nThe eight-core 16-thread flagship Core i9-11900K comes with a suggested $539 price tag, a $51 markup over the previous-gen ten-core 10900K. The 11900K slots in for $10 less than the Ryzen 9 5900X, which means we're looking at an eight-core chip taking on a 12-core 24-thread chip that will easily beat it in threaded workloads. Intel's obvious goal here is to beat the 5900X at gaming so it can justify the price tag.",

Instead, the 10900K competes with the 12-core 24-thread Ryzen 9 3900X in terms of both performance and price, but Intel's chip has the highest power consumption we've seen recently on the mainstream desktop. Intel pushes the 10900K's TDP envelope up to 125W (a 30W gen-on-gen increase), but that's only a measure of base power consumption. Intel rates the processor for 250W at peak performance, and we even measured peaks as high as 325W at out-of-the-box settings. Naturally, that results in a lot of heat. \n\nHowever, provided you have adequate cooling, the Core i9-10900K is unquestionably the fastest gaming processor on the market. It also offers incredibly snappy performance in lightly-threaded apps, and solid performance in heavily-threaded workloads. Despite its insatiable power consumption and high heat output, the 10900K will be sure to find some uptake from performance enthusiasts that are prepared to splurge on a robust motherboard, power supply, and cooler, but most users would be better served with cheaper AMD alternatives, like the Ryzen 9 3900X.",

The Core i7-10700K also proves to be a nimble overclocker that doesn't generate an untenable amount of excess heat, so off-the-shelf water coolers can unlock big gains. \n\nOverall, the Core i7-10700K gives you nearly the same gaming performance as the Core i9-10900K, but for $110 less, and overclocking eliminates any meaningful difference in gaming performance between the chips. You also get extremely competitive single-threaded performance at stock settings. \n\nThe Core i7-10700K leads in gaming, but cost-conscious shoppers may prefer Intel's own Core i5-1600K, which is a better value for lower-cost gaming rigs. This leaves the Core i7-10700K as a good choice for high-end gaming machines, and it definitely takes the shine off Intel's Core i9-10900K (and its egregious power consumption) for overclocking enthusiasts and the frame-rate obsessed.",

    "articlecontents": "The Apple Silicon M1 System on a Chip (SOC), combined with some brilliant software from Apple, allows the new MacBook Pro to do things that no Intel-based laptop I've ever owned could do. \nThe fans almost never turn on, the chassis stays cool to the touch during the most extreme benchmarks, and every app we used, weather it was optimized for Apple Silicon or being emulated in real-time by Apple's Rosetta 2 software performed better than we expected. \n\nApple is much further ahead than anybody expected them to be with these 1st generation Apple Silicon devices. Rosetta 2 emulation is so good it's practically invisible, performance exceeds price point by a lot (at least by Apple standards), and efficiency is absolutely mind-blowing. I hoped for \"good\" with the ARM-based apps, and \"Usable\" with non-optimized apps; I did not expect improved performance at 1/4 the power draw and 3/4 the price. \n\nBut whether you need a new Mac right away or you're willing to wait and see what Apple sticks inside the iMac or next-gen 16-inch MacBook Pro, there's one thing I can say without any hesitation: this changes everything.",
